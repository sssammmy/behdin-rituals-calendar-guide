                    <strong>Ushahin GƒÅh</strong> (just before sunrise the following day).

                  When a Zoroastrian passes away, several important prayers and rituals should be performed immediately. 
                  These ceremonies help guide the soul of the departed on its journey and provide comfort to the grieving family.

                <p>
                  The Sachkar ceremony is one of the first rituals performed after death. This ceremony should ideally 
                  be performed within the first few hours of passing. During this ceremony, the body is ritually washed 
                  and prepared for funeral services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Who performs it:</strong> Traditionally performed by family members of the same gender as the deceased, 
                  but in many communities outside Iran, this may be performed by funeral home professionals with guidance from a priest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Key prayers:</strong> Sarosh Baj, portions of the Avesta

                <p>
                  This is a prayer ceremony performed before the funeral, usually at a funeral home or temple. The priest recites 
                  prayers over the body before it is taken for funeral services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Timing:</strong> Usually performed within 24 hours of passing, but may vary based on local customs and practical considerations.

                <p>
                  <strong>Notes for services outside Iran:</strong> While traditional Zoroastrian practice involves exposure of the body (dakhmenashini), 
                  in most countries outside Iran, burial or cremation is practiced. Most Zoroastrians in North America opt for cremation as it is closer to 
                  the traditional practice of not polluting the earth with burial.
